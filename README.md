## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

This is the first time I use NextJS and CSS grid to build a project. 

### Continued development

This is my first React project with NextJS so there are a lot of things I do not get used to, I will keep building React project with NextJS to learn more about this framework. Besides, I still struggle with typescript, therefore, I intend to use Typescript for my next projects.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to CSS Grid] (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me gain knowledge about CSS grid. Thanks to this guide, I can use CSS grid for this project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
